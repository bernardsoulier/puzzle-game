Fox cabbage chicken game

So the farmer is on one side of a stream and needs to get to the other side and bring everything with him.  A small rowboat is on this side of the stream.  It can only fit the farmer And one other item at a time.

The game implementation should be a touch interface, 2d game.  It should check for legal item placements, allow sliding boat back And forth across the stream.
